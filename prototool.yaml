  # The path to the file header or the file header content for all Protobuf files.
  # If either path or content is set and the FILE_HEADER linter is turned on,
  # files will be checked to begin with the given header, and format --fix
  # will place this header before the syntax declaration. Note that
  # format --fix will delete anything before the syntax declaration
  # if this is set.
  #
  # Set path to use a file's contents for the header. Path must be relative.
  # Set content to directly specify the header.
  # **Both path and content cannot be set at the same time. They are only done
  # so here for example purposes.**

  # If is_commented is set, this file is assumed to already have comments
  # and will be added directly. If is_commented is not set, "// " will be
  # added before every line.
